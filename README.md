# Advent of Code 2023
Solutions to 2023's daily challenges 

This year, I'm back to **Go** as I approach AoC with software craftsmanship in mind.  My main goal is to **complete both parts for the first 10 days**.  I'll also keep two practices in mind:

* **Test-Driven Development** - rather than rely on numerous log statements and manual parsing, I'll write unit tests for each day and use them to iterate towards a solution.
* **Reusability** - AoC puzzles often use the same handful of data structures and operations.  I'll use Go generics and usecase-agnostic code to gradually build a library of convenient code.
